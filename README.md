## Introduction to Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?

Welcome to our first lecture on Kubernetes.

Today, we'll explore a vital question: What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform used for container orchestration. It's become the
standard tool for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

First, let's understand container orchestration. It refers to the management of the life cycles of containers,
particularly in large and dynamic environments.

Many of you might be familiar with Docker, a platform that helped popularize containerization. Docker allows developers
to bundle applications with all their dependencies into a single container. This makes it easier to develop, test, and
deploy applications consistently across various environments.

Containers revolutionized software deployment by offering a lightweight, consistent environment for running
applications. However, as applications grow more complex, manually managing numerous containers becomes impractical.

This challenge led to the development of container orchestration tools. Imagine having a skilled conductor for an
orchestra of containers, automating tasks like deployment, scaling, and management.

While Docker introduced Docker Swarm to orchestrate containers, it was not fully equipped to handle large-scale
environments efficiently.

This is where Kubernetes comes into play. It builds on Docker’s capabilities, providing a powerful orchestration layer
that allows for effective management and scaling of applications. Over time, Kubernetes has become the most popular
choice for container orchestration, thanks to its efficiency and capability to handle complex applications.

Kubernetes was initially developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, or CNCF. It
leverages Google's vast experience in managing containers at scale and is compatible with various container runtimes,
including Docker.

What can Kubernetes do for us? It automates deployments, enabling you to define how your applications should run, while
it takes care of the actual deployment process. Kubernetes also manages scaling and load balancing, automatically
adjusting your application's capacity based on the load and distributing traffic to maintain high availability.

Moreover, Kubernetes facilitates self-healing by detecting and replacing failed containers or nodes. It operates on a
declarative configuration model— you specify the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes works to make it a
reality.

Kubernetes not only orchestrates our containers but also enhances our deployment strategies, scales applications, and
ensures robust production environments.

In our next lecture, we will delve deeper into the architecture of Kubernetes and understand how it functions
internally.

I look forward to seeing you in our next session!
