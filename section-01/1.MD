# What is a container orchestrator?

First, let's understand what a container orchestrator is and what it's used for.

A container orchestrator is a system designed for automation—the automation of the entire lifecycle of containers,
covering every phase of your application's existence. Container orchestrators focus on the deployment and provisioning
aspects. This means that once a system is deployed, it can also be provisioned in various ways, such as allocating
specific amounts of memory or processing power to servers. Essentially, a container orchestrator manages all these
tasks.

Another critical element, especially in Kubernetes, which is a popular container orchestrator, is networking. Kubernetes
features a fully virtualized network environment complete with DNS and Proxy Services, which we will explore throughout
this course. It efficiently routes requests from your clients to the appropriate applications. When an application is
requested, Kubernetes orchestrates the process to connect each client with the services they need within the system.

Scaling is another vital feature. It can be managed imperatively, through terminal commands, or automatically. The
beauty of this setup is that it allows operators, the professionals deploying the application, to relax a bit. With
simple commands or configuration files, which we'll discuss, the system can scale up or down—increasing or decreasing
the number of applications and resources easily and effortlessly.

Availability is another crucial aspect. An application should be as available as possible. Consider the impact of a
major website like Amazon going down. The potential damage could be immense, especially during peak times like Black
Friday when usage spikes dramatically. In such scenarios, a container orchestrator like Kubernetes becomes
indispensable. It adjusts to the increased demand by enhancing service responsiveness, thus handling a surge of new
users effectively and maintaining high availability. If a server receives too many requests, it could fail, leading to
significant sales losses during critical shopping events. But with Kubernetes, this risk is mitigated as it manages the
containers to ensure that applications remain responsive and available as much as possible.

This management—from the deployment of an application to its eventual discontinuation when it's no longer needed or
replaced by a new version or service—is what makes container orchestrators so valuable in the tech ecosystem.
